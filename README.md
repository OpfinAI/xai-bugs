# XAI Bugs and Experiments

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks for experiments and bug investigations related to Explainable AI (XAI) libraries, including SHAP, InterpretML, LightGBM, and FastTreeSHAP.


## Notebooks Overview

- **BayesianOptimization.ipynb**  
  Experiments with Bayesian optimization techniques.

- **lgbm_objective.ipynb**  
  Investigates SHAP explanations for LightGBM models, including objective-related issues.

- **lgbm_objective_fast.ipynb**  
  Uses FastTreeSHAP for efficient SHAP value computation on tree models.

- **SuccessfulAdditiveExplainer.ipynb**  
  Demonstrates a successful use of SHAP's Additive explainer with InterpretML's ExplainableBoostingClassifier.

- **UnsuccessfulAdditiveExplainer.ipynb**  
  Documents a failure case when using SHAP's Additive explainer with InterpretML models.
